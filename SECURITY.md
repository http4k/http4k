# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any potential security vulnerabilities in the http4k ecosystem, please report them through GitHub's
private vulnerability reporting feature.

For vulnerabilities in third party dependencies, we monitor these separately and update as soon as a fix is released by the maintainers.
Our normal policy is to fix-forward.
