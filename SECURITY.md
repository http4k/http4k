# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

http4k is released on a regular basis, generally as soon as fixes are available. We recommend keeping http4k up-to-date in order that any changes 
to APIs will not need to be mixed in with security patches.

| Version       | Supported          |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| 4.x           | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.x and below | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please reach out to: `security@http4k.org` if you find a vulnerability with http4k code. Typically you can expect a response the same working day. 

For vulnerabilities in third party dependencies, we monitor these separately and update as soon as a fix is released by the maintainers.
Our normal policy is to fix-forward.
