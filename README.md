 [http4k] is a lightweight but fully-featured HTTP toolkit written in pure [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) that enables the serving and consuming of HTTP services in a functional and consistent way. [http4k] applications are *just* Kotlin functions which can be mounted into a running backend. For example, here's a simple echo server:
 
```kotlin
 val app: HttpHandler = { request: Request -> Response(OK).body(request.body) }
 val server = app.asServer(SunHttp(8000)).start()
```

[http4k] consists of a core library, `http4k-core`, providing a base HTTP implementation + a number of capability abstractions (such as servers, clients, templating, websockets etc). These capabilities are then implemented in add-on modules.

The principles of [http4k] are:

* **Application as a Function:** Based on the Twitter paper ["Your Server as a Function"](https://monkey.org/~marius/funsrv.pdf), all HTTP services can be composed 
of 2 types of simple function:
    * *HttpHandler:* `(Request) -> Response` - provides a remote call for processing a Request. 
    * *Filter:* `(HttpHandler) -> HttpHandler` - adds Request/Response pre/post processing. These filters are composed to make stacks of reusable behaviour that can 
    then be applied to an `HttpHandler`.
* **Immutability:** All entities in the library are immutable unless their function explicitly disallows this.
* **Symmetric:** The `HttpHandler` interface is identical for both HTTP services and clients. This allows for simple offline testability of applications, as well as 
plugging together of services without HTTP container being required.
* **Dependency-lite:** Apart the from Kotlin StdLib, `http4k-core` module has **ZERO** dependencies and weighs in at ~1mb. Add-on modules only have dependencies required for specific implementation.
* **Testability** Built by **TDD** enthusiasts, so supports **super-easy** mechanisms for both In and Out of Container testing of:
    * individual endpoints
    * applications
    * websockets
    * full suites of microservices
