 [http4k] is a lightweight but fully-featured HTTP toolkit written in pure [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) that enables the serving and consuming of HTTP services in a functional and consistent way. [http4k] applications are *just* Kotlin functions. For example, here's a simple echo server:
 
```kotlin
 val app: HttpHandler = { request: Request -> Response(OK).body(request.body) }
 val server = app.asServer(SunHttp(8000)).start()
```

[http4k] consists of a lightweight core library, `http4k-core`, providing a base HTTP implementation and Server/Client implementations based on the JDK classes. Further servers, clients, serverless, templating, websockets capabilities are then implemented in add-on modules. [http4k] apps can be simply mounted into a running Server, Serverless platform, or compiled to GraalVM and run as a super-lightweight binary.

The principles of [http4k] are:

* **Application as a Function:** Based on the Twitter paper ["Your Server as a Function"](https://monkey.org/~marius/funsrv.pdf), all HTTP services can be composed 
of 2 types of simple function:
    * *HttpHandler:* `(Request) -> Response` - provides a remote call for processing a Request. 
    * *Filter:* `(HttpHandler) -> HttpHandler` - adds Request/Response pre/post processing. These filters are composed to make stacks of reusable behaviour that can 
    then be applied to an `HttpHandler`.
* **Immutability:** All entities in the library are immutable unless their function explicitly disallows this.
* **Symmetric:** The `HttpHandler` interface is identical for both HTTP services and clients. This allows for simple offline testability of applications, as well as 
plugging together of services without HTTP container being required.
* **Dependency-lite:** Apart the from Kotlin StdLib, `http4k-core` module has **ZERO** dependencies and weighs in at ~1mb. Add-on modules only have dependencies required for specific implementation.
* **Testability** Built by **TDD** enthusiasts, so supports **super-easy** mechanisms for both in-memory and port-based testing of:
    * individual endpoints
    * applications
    * websockets/sse
    * full suites of microservices
* **Portable** Apps are completely portable across deployment platform in either a Server-based, Serverless or Native binaries.
    
## Quickstart
Bored with reading already and just want to get coding? For the impatient, visit the [http4k toolbox](https://toolbox.http4k.org) to generate a complete project from the wide variety of http4k modules.

Alternatively, read the [quickstart](https://www.http4k.org/quickstart/) or take a look at the [examples repo](https://github.com/http4k/examples), which showcases a variety of [http4k] use-cases and features.

This quick example is designed to convey the simplicity & features of [http4k] . See also the [quickstart](https://http4k.org/quickstart/) for the simplest possible starting point and demonstrates how to serve and consume HTTP services with dynamic routing.

To install, add these dependencies to your **Gradle** file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("org.http4k:http4k-bom:5.12.2.1"))
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-core")
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-server-jetty")
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-client-okhttp")
}
```

import org.http4k.routing.path
import org.http4k.routing.routes
import org.http4k.server.Jetty
import org.http4k.server.asServer

fun main() {
    // we can bind HttpHandlers (which are just functions from  Request -> Response) to paths/methods to create a Route,
    // then combine many Routes together to make another HttpHandler
    val app: HttpHandler = routes(
        "/ping" bind GET to { _: Request -> Response(OK).body("pong!") },
        "/greet/{name}" bind GET to { req: Request ->
            val name: String? = req.path("name")
            Response(OK).body("hello ${name ?: "anon!"}")
        }
    )

    // call the handler in-memory without spinning up a server
    val inMemoryResponse: Response = app(Request(GET, "/greet/Bob"))
    println(inMemoryResponse)

// Produces:
//    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
//
//

    // this is a Filter - it performs pre/post processing on a request or response
    val timingFilter = Filter {
        next: HttpHandler ->
        {
            request: Request ->
            val start = System.currentTimeMillis()
            val response = next(request)

    }

    // we can "stack" filters to create reusable units, and then apply them to an HttpHandler
    val compositeFilter = CachingFilters.Response.NoCache().then(timingFilter)
    val filteredApp: HttpHandler = compositeFilter.then(app)

    // only 1 LOC to mount an app and start it in a container
    filteredApp.asServer(Jetty(9000)).start()

    // HTTP clients are also HttpHandlers!
    val client: HttpHandler = OkHttp()

    val networkResponse: Response = client(Request(GET, "http://localhost:9000/greet/Bob"))
    println(networkResponse)

// Produces:
//    Request to /api/greet/Bob took 1ms
//    HTTP/1.1 200
//    cache-control: private, must-revalidate
//    content-length: 9
//    date: Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:01:13 GMT
//    expires: 0
//    server: Jetty(9.3.16.v20170120)
//
//    hello Bob
