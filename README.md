[http4k] is a lightweight but fully-featured HTTP toolkit written in pure [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) that enables the serving and consuming of HTTP
services in a functional and consistent way. [http4k] applications are *just* Kotlin functions. For example, here's a simple echo server:

```kotlin
val app: HttpHandler = { request: Request -> Response(OK).body(request.body) }
val server = app.asServer(SunHttp(8000)).start()
```

You can read about the rationale and ethos of http4k [here](https://http4k.org/rationale)

The [http4k] platform consists of the following main ecosystems, all released under a single version:

- [http4k-core](./core) consists of a lightweight core library providing a base HTTP implementation and Server/Client implementations based on the JDK classes. Further servers, clients, serverless, templating, websockets capabilities are then implemented in add-on modules. [http4k] apps can be simply mounted into a running Server, Serverless platform, or compiled to GraalVM and run as a super-lightweight binary.
- [http4k-connect](./connect) is a lightweight API Client toolkit which includes libraries for connecting to popular third-party cloud
  services and AI backends using [http4k](https://http4k.org) compatible APIs, along with Fake implementations for usage during local
  testing.

<h2>Sounds cool! Where can I find out more?</h2>

You can find out all about the project on the [http4k] site.

## Installation
```kotlin
dependencies {
    // install the platform...
    implementation(platform("org.http4k:http4k-bom:5.36.0.0"))

    // ...then choose any moduless but at least the core
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-core")
}
```
