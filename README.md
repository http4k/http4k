[http4k] is a lightweight but fully-featured HTTP toolkit written in pure [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) that enables the serving and consuming of HTTP
services in a functional and consistent way. [http4k] applications are *just* Kotlin functions. For example, here's a simple echo server:

```kotlin
val app: HttpHandler = { request: Request -> Response(OK).body(request.body) }
val server = app.asServer(SunHttp(8000)).start()
```

[http4k] consists of a lightweight core library, `http4k-core`, providing a base HTTP implementation and Server/Client implementations based on the JDK classes.
Further servers, clients, serverless, templating, websockets capabilities are then implemented in add-on modules. [http4k] apps can be simply mounted into a
running Server, Serverless platform, or compiled to GraalVM and run as a super-lightweight binary.

You can read about the rationale and ethos of http4k [here](https://http4k.org/rationale)

dependencies {
    // install the platform...
    implementation(platform("org.http4k:http4k-bom:5.33.0.1"))

    // ...then choose any moduless but at least the core
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-core")
}
```
