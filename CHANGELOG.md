<h2 class="github">Changelog</h2>

This list is not currently intended to be all-encompassing - it will document major and breaking API changes with their rationale when appropriate:

### v3.35.0 (uncut)
- Added first cut of `http4-testing-chaos` module. Massive H/T to @IgorPerikov for the PR which drove this module's creation. API might change a bit as we experiment/expand it.

### v3.34.3
- Fix #160 - `JavaHttpClient` does not copy body stream correctly onto URL connection.

### v3.34.2
- Fix #159 - Contracts should not have Security applied to the description route by default.

### v3.34.1
- Fix #158 - Static and contract routes filters are applied in the wrong order.

### v3.34.0
- Add default SamplingDecision param to ZipkinTraces - defaults to always sample.
- Fix #150 - StaticRoutingHandler filters being called twice.
- Fix #151 - POTENTIAL BREAK: Rework of Status objects to fix equality against the Status constant `vals` when a description has been overridden. This involves the following potential breaking change: The Status class is no longer a data class to tighten up encapsulation - user calls to copy() will have to be replaced.

### v3.33.2
- Raise SO_BACKLOG in Apache and Netty server implementations.
- Add PERMANENT_REDIRECT and UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY Status object.

### v3.33.1
- No change from 3.33.0. Previous version couldn't be made available to maven central.

### v3.33.0
- Add convenient way to extract from as a Map from http message. H/T to @dmcg (this version is available in jcenter only)

### v3.32.1
- Fix #142 - Pebble templates don't load from JAR files.

### v3.32.0
- Add support for propagation of the Zipkin x-b3-sampled header

### v3.31.0
- Changes to the Netty factory to enable running http4k on GraalVM. H/T @RichyHBM

### v3.30.0
- Allow all server implementations to start on port 0 (ie. find a free port) and then report it back as a part of the `Http4kServer` interface

### v3.29.0
- Make HTTP clients resilient to unknown host and connectionrefused exceptions
- Implememted #134 - Added default (de)serialization for common JDK primitives to all Auto-marshalling JSON modules - eg. datetimes and UUIDs

### v3.28.0
- Fix #131 - Uri's created with paths that don't contain leading slashes.
- Added etag parser filter. H/T @dgliosca for the PR
- Fix #132 - Ensured that `disableDefaultTyping` is called in default Jackson implementation. This should be the default anyway, but has been added to ensure that we don't fall foul of [CVE-2017-7525](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1723) and to surface awareness of this issue.

### v3.27.0
- OpenAPI now provides example values in the generated schema. H/T @skewwhiffy for the PR.

### v3.26.6
- Fix #126 - ResourceLoadingHandler can expose mapped resources into the root. <-- We think this is an important update, so please upgrade!

### v3.26.5
- Fix #125 - ApacheServer implementation now sets content length if present.

### v3.26.4
- Fix #123 - Multipart Body objects blow up when parsed after being debugged. As with all streams, care should be taken to not blow heap when internalising them for debugging purposes.

### v3.26.3
- Debugging filter now supports ignoring Multipart streams.

### v3.26.2
- Tweak: OpenAPI now doesn't return null values in the schema.

### v3.26.1
- Fix #124 - headers in WebSocket upgrade request are incorrectly joined.

### v3.26.0
- Removed `supportedContentTypes` field from OpenApi contract JSON, since this is a legacy field.

### v3.25.0
- Added option to Undertow to enable HTTP2 from main ServerConfig

### v3.24.0
- Upgrade various dependencies for Java 10 compatibility. H/T @tom
- Fix bug with repeated params in Websocket upgrade request. H/T @tom

### v3.23.1
- Composite LensFailures now capture (at least) the first failing cause (probably the body parameter in the case of an `http4k-contract` module.

### v3.23.0
- Fix #116 - Can provide a custom Response creation method for `CatchLensFailure`. H/T @elifarley for the inspiration!

### v3.22.4
- Added singleton method for Json.array, since if you pass in a single JsonNode (Jackson), it accidentally iterates over the fields in the node instead of using the object as an entry in the array.
- Fix #115 - Only add content-length for methods that allow content in AwsAuth filter

### v3.22.3
- Preserve routing information on request/response manipulation  

### v3.22.2
- `http4k-security-oauth` module added - with support for OAuth2 Authorization Grant flow
- Replaced classes reliant on `javax.activation` package, which allows Java 9+ to not require any external dependencies. \o/
- Fix #112 - `ApacheClient` incorrectly sets headers on GET requests (this breaks F5 load balancers). H/T @simojenki
- PR #110 - Websocket client timeouts are incorrectly translated as seconds instead of millis. HT @anorth
- Core `JavaHttpClient` does not support streaming due to limitations with `HttpURLConnection` 

### v3.21.1
- Fix #109 - Jackson treats integer values inconsistently, leading to matching errors when using hamkrest.

### v3.21.0
- Fix #107 - Killed the x-uri-template header and fixed the ReportHttpTransaction to have access to the `routingGroup`.
- Altered ordering of filters in `http4k-contract` so that the route is identified before pre-filters and security are applied. This allows knowledge of the path to be accessible at the time of application of those filters.

### v3.20.0
- Introduce JavaHttpClient to `http4k-core`. It provides a very basic http client without  any other 3rd party dependencies.

### v3.19.0
- PR #104 - Add optional time/date formatters to LensSpecs so you can choose you serialisation format. H/T @elifarley
- Fix #105 - Swagger API json file: duplicate key in "definitions".

### v3.18.1
- Fixed PR #100 - URI template regex required extra escaping. This only affects Android deployments as IDE shows the regex escaping is redundant. H/T @privatwolke

### v3.18.0
- Breaking: converted contract pre-security filter to be a post-security filter. This means that all standard filters are applied before the security later, which allows for logging and monitoring and context setup. The previous filter mechanic applied security first, which didn't allow for this. In the unlikely event that post-security filters still need to be applied, use the `withPostSecurityFilter()` function when building the contract.
- Docs for contract RouteMeta function parameters, and deprecated some unused functions (missed when we introduced the DSL).
- PR #99 - Contract routes now support up to 10 path segments. Thanks to @scap1784 for the PR! :)

### v3.17.1
- Fix #97. Moshi does not fail when deserialise non-nullable fields correctly. Note that GSON still suffers from this problem

### v3.17.0
- Added a pre-security filter option to contract creation, so that you can explicitly specify behaviour to occur before security kicks in.

### v3.16.0
- Convert `Security` (from sealed class) and `ApiKey` to be interfaces. This allows users to implement their own security models.

### v3.15.0
- Introduce `HttpTransaction` and new `ReportHttpTransaction` filter provide better generic API for reporting, along with the ability to label transactions for this purpose.
- Breaking: Rework the metrics request counter and timer Filter API. There is now a `HttpTransactionLabeller` for you to add as many labels as required to the transaction. Each of these labels will be used to tag the metric.

### v3.14.1
- Fix #95 - Filters are now applied to "route not found" responses

### v3.14.0
- Fix #93 - Apache server doesn't like content-length or transfer-encoding headers present in http4k response.
- Add ability to "name" input and output contract body definitions in an OpenAPI JSON doc. This applies to only the top level entity. If no override is passed, the objects are named according to their hashcode.

### 3.13.4
- Fix #92 - cookie date should always use US locale

### v3.13.3
- Further tweak to Netty. H/T @FredDeschenes

### v3.13.2
- Fix #91 - large message handli
ng in Netty

### v3.13.1
- Upgrade to Kotlin 1.2.20

### v3.13.0
- Support for `operationId` in OpenApi route metadata. H/T @danschultz for the PR.
- Removed previously deprecated methods.

### v3.12.0
- New client module `http4k-client-jetty`, which supports both sync and async models.

### v3.11.1
- Fix #84. OPTIONS requests are not detected by contract routes.
- Added option to NOT authorise OPTIONS requests in ApiKey security filter.
- Added support for Async HTTP clients and added new `AsyncHttpClient` interface, which is obviously used for HTTP clients only**, and not server-side calls. :)
- New client module `http4k-client-apache-async`.
- New metrics gathering module `http4k-metrics-micrometer`. Big H/T to @kirderf for the PR.
- Added support for async to `OkHttp` client module.

### v3.10.0
- P/R 81 - adding headers and timeout to websocket client.

### v3.9.0
- Added compactify and prettify to Json implementations
- Added `Json.hasBody` Hamkrest matchers for comparing bodies. Note these are extension methods and need to be referenced/imported as such.

### v3.8.0
- Added facility for non-blocking websocket client to react to onConnect event. This API is
the same as the inbound, server-side API - ie. there are no explicit connection event handlers. H/T @tom for the idea.

### v3.7.0
- P/R #13 Create extension methods for Response to add caching headers. H/T @k0zakinio.

### v3.6.1
- Fix #78. Serialisation of raw lists using Moshi fails in the same way as the Jackson auto-conversions do. Added convenience methods to get around this.

### v3.6.0
- Added `http4k-format-moshi` to support the Square auto-marshalling library.

### v3.5.1
- Fix #76 - encoding of path segments to use URI encoding instead of URL form encoding.

### v3.5.0
- Added support for multiple HotReload template directories in `HandlebarsTemplates`. H/T @TomShacham
- Fix #74 - Request tracing span/parentSpan set too early so was shared between outgoing requests.

### v3.4.0
- New server backend `http4k-server-apache`. H/T @kirderf for the PR :)
- We now set the length of the incoming request body when it is available in the incoming request.

### v3.3.1
- Handlebars now uses combination of Class and Template name to cache templates.

### v3.3.0
- Facility to compose `TemplateRenderers` with `then()` to provide fallback behaviour.

### v3.2.3
- PR #70: Header order equality for Request/Response - H/T @gypsydave5.

### v3.2.2
- Switched out `Status` for `WsStatus` (with proper RFC code set) in Websockets.

### v3.2.1
- Typesafe Websockets! Jetty now supports websockets, using the same style of API in the main http4k routing.
- (Possible) Breaking change: Because `WsHandler` (typealias) implements the same inbound interface as `HttpHandler`, you now cannot declare `HttpHandlers` without specifying the input type, so any "anonymous" handlers will not compile as a result. The required fix is very simple, but manual:
 `{ Response(OK) } should become { _:Request -> Response(OK) }

### v3.1.3
- Fix Request.form() for streaming requests

### v3.1.2
- Remove possibility of empty message for Path Lens failure.

### v3.1.1
- New (better!) API for `http4k-contract` module. Old meta DSL has been deprecated.

### v3.0.1
- Fix #63 - Apache Client Connect. timeout exception handling.

### v3.0.0 
- Added `http4k-serverless-lambda` module, allowing http4k applications to be deployed into AWS Lambda and then called from API Gateway. Effectively, the combination of these two services become just another Server back-end supported by the library. \o/

### v2.38.1
- `RequestContextKey` now follow the standardised Lens structure of required, optional, defaulted, and can now be removed (set to null). Replace calls
to `RequestContextKey.of()` with `RequestContextKey.required()` 
- Removed previously deprecated values. See below for details on replacements.

### v2.37.0
- Added `http4k-resilience4j` module, which adds Circuits, RateLimiters, Retrying and Bulkheading.

- Upgrade various dependency versions.
- Tidying of Multipart code.

### v2.35.1
- Fix #57. Static handlers behave oddly when combined with an HTTP verb in the routing tree.

### v2.35.0
- Fix #56. Altered behaviour of `CatchLensFailure` to NOT catch errors from unmarshalling Response objects. This was causing BAD_REQUEST to be incorrectly generated.
- Simplification of generics around LensSpecs. This should not be a breaking change, (there were 3 generics, now the MID has been removed so there are just 2) but could break if signatures are used explicitly.

### v2.34.0
- Reordered generics in LensInjector to make sense. This should have no effect on most code-bases, but could break if signatures are used explicitly. Just flip the generic types to switch.

### v2.33.1
- Added support for unsigned AWS requests, which enables streaming content to S3. 

### v2.33.0
- Added `BodyMode.Request` to configure streaming for clients.
- `ResponseBodyMode` is now `BodyMode.Response` (Breaking change. Fixable with simple find/replace).

### v2.32.0
- Added `ServerFilter.ProcessFiles` filter to stream Multipart Files, convert them into references and replace inline in the Form.

### v2.25.4
- Fix #40 - GZip filters now use content-encoding headers instead of transfer-encoding.

### v2.25.3
- Fix #39 - ResponseBodyMode.Memory properly closes streams (breaks jetty + gzip).

### v2.25.2
- Ensure that streams are closed properly when consuming from an upstream client.

### v2.25.1
- Remove Apache client request streaming because it may not release connections properly. 

### v2.25.0
- Add streaming support to HTTP Server and Client modules.
- Remove CatchLensFailure ClientFilter as it will never be used.

### v2.24.0
- Added CatchLensFailure for ClientFilters - which catches un-deserializable invalid responses from clients and generates a BAD_GATEWAY error.
