<h2 class="github">Changelog</h2>

This list is not intended to be all-encompassing - it will document major and breaking API
changes with their rationale when appropriate:

### v5.12.3.0 (uncut)

- **http4k-security-jwt** - [New Module!] Integrates the Nimbus JWT library to authorize requests for a server. H/T @oharaandrew314
- **http4k-contract** - Add new `JwtSecurity`

### v5.12.2.1
- **http4k-webhooks** : Move `VerifyWebhookSignature` filter to ServerFilters as it's not for HTTP clients!

### v5.12.2.0

- **http4k-*** : Upgrade some dependency versions
- **http4k-core** : [New module!] Support for the [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/) format
- **http4k-core** [Fix #1022] For a request with matching `if-none-match header` the response lacks the etag header. H/T @efasel
- **http4k-core** [Fix #1030] Maven POM for http4k-format-jackson-xml is invalid: jackson-dataformat-xml is missing a version

### v5.12.1.0

- **http4k-*** : Upgrade some dependency versions
- **http4k-core** : Fix lens replacement of path parameter when there is a regular expression in the path segment
- **http4k-format-jackson** : Added lens support for deserialising [data4k](https://github.com/fork-handles/forkhandles/tree/trunk/data4k) containers directly
  from HTTP message bodies (via `Body.json(::JsonNodeDataContainer)).toLens()`

### v5.12.0.0

- **http4k-*** : Upgrade some dependency versions, including Kotlin to 1.9.22, and Jetty 12 (see below).
- **http4k-server-jetty** - [Breaking] Upgrade to Jetty 12. This is a major rewrite of the Jetty engine and the API surface is incompatible with v11. If you are
  using vanilla Jetty backend then this is a NoOp replacement, otherwise fallback to using the new `Jetty11` module and then plan migration accordingly. Massive
  H/T to H/T @FredNordin for the implementation upgrade.
- **http4k-server-jetty11** - [New Module!] Drop-in replacement module for custom Jetty11 users. Constructor is now called `Jetty11()` instead of `Jetty()`, so
  migration should be very simple. Other renames as required (using `11`) to avoid API clashes in the http4k codebase.
- **http4k-aws** : [Breaking] Tweaks to the signature of `AwsPreSignRequests`. Use `AwsRequestPreSigner` instead. H/T @oharaandrew314

### v5.11.1.0

- **http4k-aws** : Pre-sign AWS requests with the new `AwsPreSignRequests` class. H/T @oharaandrew314

  http4k-serverless/lambda)

### v5.11.0.0

- **http4k-*** : Upgrade some dependency versions
- **http4k-core** : [Unlikely Break: Fix #1011] Jackson does not honour serialisation of Enums when they are used as Map
  keys. The fix MAY break JSON serialisation (which actually is a bug as the expected behaviour is for the Enums to use
  the predefined mapping).

  get around this, create your own Moshi configuration, omitting the `CollectionEdgeCasesAdapter`
- **http4k-websocket-*** : [Breaking] Added support for filters with `WsFilter`, which can be wrapped around
  a `WsHandler` or `WsConsumer` to decorate them with behaviour. This has involved changing `WsHandler` to always return
  a `WsConsumer` even if it doesn't match - in the case of a non-match, the socket is closed immediately.
- **http4k-sse-*** : [Breaking] Added support for filters with `SseFilter`, which can be wrapped around a `SseHandler`
  or `SseConsumer` to decorate them with behaviour. This has involved changing `SseHandler` to always return
  a `SseConsumer` even if it doesn't match - in the case of a non-match, the socket is closed immediately.
- **http4k-*** : Upgrade some dependency versions.
- **http4k-core** : Repackaging of non-core classes for SSE/WebSockets into new `http4k-realtime-core` module. No action
  required unless these classes are needed without an implementation.
- **http4k-core** : Repackaging of non-core classes for Serverless into new `http4k-serverless-core` module. No action
  required unless these classes are needed without an implementation.

  JAR when using the OAuthServer

### v4.7.0.0

- **http4k-core** : Fix #606 - SPA routers do not respond to OPTIONS requests.
- **http4k-security-oauth** : Replace Jackson with Moshi. This has had the effect of removing any reflection from the
  module (and thus saving 2.5Mb of Kotlin-Reflection dependency). If you still need Jackson, then you need to manually
  add it as a dependency as it was probably missing from your dependency list! :)

- **http4k-server-jetty** : We have been alerted to some runtime changes around how Jetty parses paths containing .
  or /. Workaround is to use `HttpConfiguration.httpCompliance = HttpCompliance.RFC7230_LEGACY`, but this is marked as
  legacy and will be deprecated sooner or later. See details
  at: https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/6001#issuecomment-786611040
- **http4k-format-moshi** : Moshi now supports AutoMarshallingEvents out of the box.

- **http4k-testing-webdriver** : [Breaking] Upgrade of APIs to match new v4 Selenium APIs. It is quite safe to continue
  to use previous versions of the `http4k-testing-webdriver` JAR if you are unable to upgrade immediately. The API is
  reasonably the same, but some of the imports have changed. The main one is that instead of
  importing `org.openqa.selenium.By` you should import `org.http4k.webdriver.By`, which is the new custom
  implementation.
- **http4k-core** : Replace `hostDemux()` with `reverseProxy()`.

  due to open bug with nullable fields. See: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/435 . There is a
  workaround which is to add default values into the nullable fields in your DTO classes. eg.

 ```kotlin
data class MyDto(val field: String? = null)
```

  persistence and retrieved on successful requests H/T @tom

### v3.273.0

- **http4k-*** : Upgrade some dependency versions.
- **http4k-core** [Small break]: Rework of ParameterMatch to consolidate with RouterMatch as they are kind of the same

  eg. `Filter filter = next -> req -> next.invoke(request.header("foo", "bar"));`
- **http4k-testing-kotest - Possible Break**: DUE TO KOTLIN 1.4.10. Remove a `haveBody` matcher which
  uses `Matcher<JsonNode>` directly, because of a bug in Kotest:
  https://github.com/kotest/kotest/issues/1727

  are added by default by the old Java8 implementation will no longer be added.
- **http4k-core, Breaking** : Change `Body.binary()` lens to use an InputStream instead of a raw `Body`. To fix, just
  provide the InputStream by calling `Body.stream()` or similar.

### v3.252.0

- **http4k-server-apache, http4k-client-apache, http4k-client-apache-async, Breaking** : Updated to Apache HTTP 5.X.X.
  H/T to @jshiell. Note that the underlying Apache APIs have changed in the v5 release. For the clients, this should
  only break if you have customised the underlying HTTP `CloseableHttpClient` that is passed to the constructor of the
  http4k client. If you have, we have you covered with....
- **http4k-server-apache4, http4k-client-apache4, http4k-client-apache4-async** : New modules to maintain previous

  us to support `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` (405) if we match a path but not a verb instead of just `NOT_FOUND` (404). This
  should break custom ro H/T @jshiell for the PR.

### v3.241.0

- **http4k-testing-approval** : Made content-type aware approval tests check the content type after the content. This is
  friendlier for failing tests, as
  it is more important that the content is correct than the content-type (and often errors don't have content type set
  so you
  get an erroneous error message which masks the fact that the content was wrong).

### v3.133.0

- **http4k-cloudnative** : `HandleUpstreamRequestFailed` client filter now takes a predicate `(Response) -> Boolean`
  instead of a boolean. This allows for more fine grained custom control of which Responses are acceptable.
- **http4k-*** : Upgrade deps, including Kotlin to `1.3.30`.
- **http4k-contract** : Fix #221 - Contract path fixed segments cannot contain slash characters.

### v3.132.0

- **http4k-format-jackson** : Convert `Jackson` to use `readValue` instead of `convertValue`. This fixes some problems
  with type conversions.

### v3.131.0

- **http4k-core** : (Possible) Break: Made lense implementations `Query, Header etc` clear previous values by default
  instead of
  appending. This leads to a more consistent behaviour. In order to be able to set multiple values on an object
  using a lense, use the `multi` form instead - eg. `Header.required("foo")` -> `Header.multi.required("foo")`. We
  envisage the impact of this change is limited as it's only Queries that generally can have multiple possible
  values, and in the vast majority of cases a replace rather than append is expected.

### v3.130.0

- **http4k-contract** : Generify contract handling code to allow for custom `HttpMessageMeta<XYZ>`

### v3.129.0

- (Slight) Break: Collapsed `UpstreamRequestFailed` exceptions to contain the status, and thus removing non-special
  cases like `BadRequest` and `BadGateway`. This makes them much easier to use in practice as users have access
  to the the status. To migrate, simply replace previous classes with `UpstreamRequestFailed(Status.XYZ, message)`.
- **http4k-contract** : Open up `ContractRoute` API to facilitate extension when defining a custom `ContractRenderer`.
- **http4k-*** : Upgrade deps.

### v3.128.0

- **http4k-core** : Added base64 to the supported mappings for Query/Headers etc...
- **http4k-testing-approval** : Approver does not write actual output if there is none to write and there is no approved
  content

### v3.127.0

- **http4k-testing-approval** : Improved `Approver` interface to more closely match the traditional
  `assert<XYZ>` approach - this results in a more discoverable/obvious API.
- **http4k-testing-hamkrest** : Added ability to create a Hamkrest matcher directly from the `Approver` instance to be
  combined
  with other relevant matchers.

### v3.126.0

- **http4k-testing-approval** : Add support for XML and HTML approval tests.

### v3.125.0

- Added `http4k-testing-approval` module, which is compatible with JUnit5 tests and integrates with
  the [OkeyDoke](https://github.com/dmcg/okey-doke) approval testing files and IntelliJ plugin. H/T to
  @jshiell for the inspiration Gist containing the base Junit5 Extension.

### v3.124.0

- **http4k-security-oauth** : Make authentication response available when creating AuthorizationCode.

### v3.123.0

- **http4k-security-oauth** : Introduce OAuthServer to `http4k-security-oauth` to assist in the creation of
  authorization servers.

### v3.122.0

- Generified `GenerateXmlDataClasses` filter, and added default implementations for
  `http4k-format-jackson-xml` and `http4k-format-xml` modules.
- (Rename) Break: `GenerateXmlDataClasses` filter in `http4k-format-xml` is now `GsonGenerateXmlDataClasses`
- Removed superfluous `CatchLensFailure` filter from `http4k-contracts` module. This is not required
  as lens failures are already handled by the main contract handler.

### v3.121.0

- Moved Jackson XML support to new module `http4k-format-jackson-xml`. Note that this is for
  auto-marshalling of data-classes only and does not expose an XML DOM model.

### v3.120.0

- Deprecated `Body.view()` lens construction in favour of a `Body.viewModel()` call which removes the
  implicitly called `toLens()`. This allows further mapping from one `ViewModel` type to another,
  and brings the view lens construction into line with the rest of the extension functions on `Body`.
- Add auto-marshalling XML support to `http4k-format-jackson` module.
- Upgrade deps.

### v3.119.0

- Add `UpstreamRequestFailed` exceptions and `HandleUpstreamRequestFailed` filters to
  `http4k-cloudnative`. These allow apps to neatly deal with upstream failure in a sensible way.

### v3.118.0

- Tweak `contract()` DSL to add remaining options for configuration.

### v3.117.0

- Renamed `ChaosControls` (deprecated) to `ChaosEngine`.

### v3.116.0

- Added new templating module `http4k-templates-freemarker`. H/T @amcghie for the PR implementing this
- `http4k-contract` has a new DSL for construction of the contract which replaces the old one (now
  deprecated). This is consistent with the `meta` DSL used to construct individual contract routes
  and avoids repetition of the old API. We attempted to implement the standard replace-with deprecation, but IntelliJ
  didn't like it (too complex maybe), so we've hard coded the warning instead which code which should work.
- Added `PreFlightExtraction` to contract module, which adds the ability to disable body-checking for contract routes.
  This will allow refining of routes or entire contracts to be more efficient.
- Upgrade deps.

### v3.115.1

- Fix #217 - Cannot override the definitionId of a top-level array in OpenAPI
- Upgrade deps

### v3.115.0

- Chaos now do not blat `x-uri-template` when used with a `RoutingHttpHandler`
- Simplified usage of `Once` chaos trigger.
- (Slight break) Consistentified (!) construction of Chaos Behaviours, Stages and Triggers. Replaced
  singletons with function calls. Eg. `Always -> Always()`

### v3.114.0

- (Possible Break): Fix #215 - `LensFailure` does not always include target object. Only change to the API
  is that `IN` generic in Lenses is now bounded by `IN : Any`. This fix is a actually internally consistent as
  we could not always include the target otherwise (which is an `Any?`).
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from extracted `EnvironmentKey` values.
- Secret value is now only usable once via the `use()` function.
- Upgrade to various deps.
- Removed deprecations.

### v3.113.0

- Added some common types for Environmental setup, and equivalent BiDiLens mappings
- Handle null response in Java Http client. H/T @FredNordin

### v3.112.2

- Fix #212 - allow null values in HTTP contract definitions. This does mean we lose the type definition for
  that field, but we don't blow up silently (which was the previous behaviour). H/T @xhanin

### v3.112.1

- Re-add `Path.nonEmptyString()` which was accidentally removed.

### v3.112.0

- Add support for prohibiting String unmarshalling in JSON auto-marshalling configuration.
- HTTP Contracts now use the underlying `ContractRenderer` to produce the BadRequest and NotFound responses.
  Made `OpenAPI`
  open so that these responses can be customised.

### v3.111.0

- Add support for JSON views in `Jackson` module. H/T @xhanin for the donkey work.

### v3.110.0

- Breaking: slight rearrangement of RouteMeta `receiving/returning` methods to provide consistency when defining route
  contracts.

### v3.109.0

- Moved the set of predefined String `BiDiMapping` instances to their own class. Bulked out the
  auto-mapping configuration options.

### v3.108.0

- Upgrade to various deps.
- Extracted out new `BiDiMapping` type, which encapsulates string <-> type conversions and removes a
  boatload of duplications. These conversions are now used consistently across all the various places
  (Lenses, auto-mapping).
- Improved configurability of `AutoMarshallingJson` instances.

### v3.107.0

- Upgrade to various deps.
- Fix #208 - Xml auto deserialisation incorrectly converting strings to numbers

### v3.106.1

- Fix #207 - repeating prefixes in static routes are not handled correctly. H/T @ruXlab for the PR to fix.

### v3.106.0

- Add `http4k-server-ktorcio` server backend. Note that whilst this module does allow http4k apps to plug into the
  Ktor-CIO engine, it does not provide fully front-to-back coroutine support.

### v3.105.0

- Preventing FallbackCacheControl from duplicating existing headers. H/T @leandronunes85
- Breaking: Make `Body.length` nullable instead of throwing exception when value is not available. H/T @zvozin

### v3.104.0

- Upgrade to various deps.
- Add session token support to AWS filter, and "credentials provider" to allow for rotating AWS sessions. H/T @dhobbs.
- Breaking: Moved WsClient from `org.http4k.testing` to `org.http4k.websocket`.

### v3.103.2

- Fix `access-control-allow-origin` returned when server supports multiple origins H/T @johnnorris

### v3.103.1

- (Properly) Fix #198 - Rewrote OpenApi contract to ensure it stays fixed. H/T @reik-wargaming for the help in tracking
  this down.

### v3.103.0

- "Fix" #198 - Breaking change made in `http4k-contracts` to clarify/deconfuse API. Hid `body` parameter in contract
  route meta DSL - it is now `receiving()`.
- Upgraded some dependencies, including Gradle to v5.0.
- Breaking: Resilience4j dependency upgrade causes a break when providing custom config. Simply insert the Config type
  generic to fix:
  e.g. `RetryConfig.custom()` -> `RetryConfig.custom<RetryConfig>()`

### v3.102.1

- Fix #197 - Swagger spec for form fields had incorrect description.

### v3.102.0

- Introduce interface for Environment

### v3.101.0

- Upgrades to dependencies
- Improved Client-side HTTP status descriptions
- Lenses now support Durations out of the box
- Environments now support multi-value keys (comma separated)

### v3.100.0

- Make `Undertow` API friendlier
- Fix to JsonReadinessCheckResultRenderer to actually implement the correct interface

### v3.99.0

- Enhancement of `http4k-cloudnative` - now supports extra-health check routes, and provide way to load app
  configuration via Properties files.

### v3.98.0

- Add filter allowing Gzipping based on an allowed set of content types. H/T @jshiell
- Change HttpHandler extending HttpClients to use `object invoke()` mechanism, as the individual clients have no visible
  API surface of their own. Introduced `DualSyncAsyncHttpHandler` interface.

### v3.97.0

- Webdriver checkbox handling improved. H/T @gypsydave5
- upgrade to various versions

### v3.96.0

- upgrade to Kotlin 1.3.0

### v3.95.1

- Tweak to K8S port variables.

### v3.95.0

- (Unlikely break): Change `Http4kServer` interface to return `Unit` from `stop()`. This affects all server
  implementations.
- Added DSL function for working with JSON objects (scopes JSON
  as `this`). `fun <T> Json<NODE>.invoke(Json<NODE>.() -> T)`
- New module `http4k-cloudnative` contains classes to help run http4k services inside cloud-native environments,
  including K8S.
- Upgrade some dependencies
- Deprecation: Moved `Header.Common` fields to main `Header` object. Extension properties should go there now.

### v3.94.1

- Use UTC when checking cookie expiry

### v3.94.0

- Deprecate String.toBody()
- Fix checkbox behaviour in webdriver

### ~v3.39.4~ v3.93.4

- Use Jetty latest release version (rather than RC one)

### v3.39.3

- Fix #189 - Uri toString now omits leading slash if the authority of a Uri is blank. This *could* be a potential break,
  but is actually more consistent as a Uri can currently be relative or absolute.

### v3.39.2

- Extend `SetBaseUriFrom` to support query parameters

### v3.39.1

- Added `SetBaseUriFrom` filter

### v3.39.0

- (Possible breaking change): `Json` is now only generified by a single type parameter instead of 2. For most usages,
  this type would have been identical anyway, but the upgrade of Argo has finally allowed the removal of this dead
  generic. Simply replace `Json<Node, Node>` with `Json<Node>`.
- Added Offset datetime types to all JSON auto-marshalling libraries
- Build logic for versioning is now in Kotlin. H/T @jmfayard for the PR
- Upgrade Kotlin, and various other dependencies

### v3.38.1

- Fix `withChaosControls` URL pattern so that it matches sub-routes ok on original handler

### v3.38.0

- Added `BearerAuth` and `BasicAuth` implementations which populate `RequestContexts`. Plus howto example :)

### v3.37.1

- Fix #177 - Make RequestContexts thread-safe.

### v3.37.0

- Upgrades to `http4k-testing-webdriver`. H/T @dickon for the PRs
- Added `ProxyHost` request filter which is useful for writing proxy-type apps.

### v3.36.1

- Fix #168 - Fix rest of hamkrest matchers caused by generics mishap.
- Upgrade HTTP client dependency versions.

### v3.36.0

- Added `http4k-testing-chaos` module, designed to enhance failure-mode testing for http4k apps. Massive H/T to
  @IgorPerikov for the PR which drove this module's creation.
- Added `http4k-incubator` module, for hosting developing projects and other code which might be promoted to top-level
  modules in the future.

### v3.35.2

- Fix #167 - Reintroduce `hasBody` compatibility with common matchers such as `containsString()`
- Remove deprecations.

### v3.35.1

- Fix #165 - AWS auth filter does not replace headers - it sets them (which breaks for request signing)
- Fix #164 - Webdriver internal state breaks when navigating to a full URL
- Fix #162 - `SetHostFrom` doesn't set 'Host' header correctly (missing port). H/T @elifarley

### v3.35.0

- Added some regex matchers to `http4k-testing-hamkrest`.
- Added `BearerAuth` authentication Server and Client Filters - these work similarly to `BasicAuth`.
- Added option for `defaulted()` lenses to fall back to another supplied lens in the case of missing value. Thanks to
  @dmcg for the inspiration. :)

### v3.34.3

- Fix #160 - `JavaHttpClient` does not copy body stream correctly onto URL connection.

### v3.34.2

- Fix #159 - Contracts should not have Security applied to the description route by default.

### v3.34.1

- Fix #158 - Static and contract routes filters are applied in the wrong order.

### v3.34.0

- Add default SamplingDecision param to ZipkinTraces - defaults to always sample.
- Fix #150 - StaticRoutingHandler filters being called twice.
- Fix #151 - POTENTIAL BREAK: Rework of Status objects to fix equality against the Status constant `vals` when a
  description has been overridden. This involves the following potential breaking change: The Status class is no longer
  a data class to tighten up encapsulation - user calls to copy() will have to be replaced.

### v3.33.2

- Raise SO_BACKLOG in Apache and Netty server implementations.
- Add PERMANENT_REDIRECT and UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY Status object.

### v3.33.1

- No change from 3.33.0. Previous version couldn't be made available to maven central.

### v3.33.0

- Add convenient way to extract from as a Map from http message. H/T to @dmcg (this version is available in jcenter
  only)

### v3.32.1

- Fix #142 - Pebble templates don't load from JAR files.

### v3.32.0

- Add support for propagation of the Zipkin x-b3-sampled header

### v3.31.0

- Changes to the Netty factory to enable running http4k on GraalVM. H/T @RichyHBM

### v3.30.0

- Allow all server implementations to start on port 0 (ie. find a free port) and then report it back as a part of
  the `Http4kServer` interface

### v3.29.0

- Make HTTP clients resilient to unknown host and connection refused exceptions
- Implemented #134 - Added default (de)serialization for common JDK primitives to all Auto-marshalling JSON modules -
  eg. date times and UUIDs

### v3.28.0

- Fix #131 - Uri's created with paths that don't contain leading slashes.
- Added etag parser filter. H/T @dgliosca for the PR
- Fix #132 - Ensured that `disableDefaultTyping` is called in default Jackson implementation. This should be the default
  anyway, but has been added to ensure that we don't fall foul
  of [CVE-2017-7525](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1723) and to surface awareness of this issue.

### v3.27.0

- OpenAPI now provides example values in the generated schema. H/T @skewwhiffy for the PR.

### v3.26.6

- Fix #126 - ResourceLoadingHandler can expose mapped resources into the root. <-- We think this is an important update,
  so please upgrade!

### v3.26.5

- Fix #125 - ApacheServer implementation now sets content length if present.

### v3.26.4

- Fix #123 - Multipart Body objects blow up when parsed after being debugged. As with all streams, care should be taken
  to not blow heap when internalising them for debugging purposes.

### v3.26.3

- Debugging filter now supports ignoring Multipart streams.

### v3.26.2

- Tweak: OpenAPI now doesn't return null values in the schema.

### v3.26.1

- Fix #124 - headers in WebSocket upgrade request are incorrectly joined.

### v3.26.0

- Removed `supportedContentTypes` field from OpenApi contract JSON, since this is a legacy field.

### v3.25.0

- Added option to Undertow to enable HTTP2 from main ServerConfig

### v3.24.0

- Upgrade various dependencies for Java 10 compatibility. H/T @tom
- Fix bug with repeated params in Websocket upgrade request. H/T @tom

### v3.23.1

- Composite LensFailures now capture (at least) the first failing cause (probably the body parameter in the case of
  an `http4k-contract` module.

### v3.23.0

- Fix #116 - Can provide a custom Response creation method for `CatchLensFailure`. H/T @elifarley for the inspiration!

### v3.22.4

- Added singleton method for Json.array, since if you pass in a single JsonNode (Jackson), it accidentally iterates over
  the fields in the node instead of using the object as an entry in the array.
- Fix #115 - Only add content-length for methods that allow content in AwsAuth filter

### v3.22.3

- Preserve routing information on request/response manipulation

### v3.22.2

- `http4k-security-oauth` module added - with support for OAuth2 Authorization Grant flow
- Replaced classes reliant on `javax.activation` package, which allows Java 9+ to not require any external dependencies.
  \o/
- Fix #112 - `ApacheClient` incorrectly sets headers on GET requests (this breaks F5 load balancers). H/T @simojenki
- PR #110 - Websocket client timeouts are incorrectly translated as seconds instead of millis. HT @anorth
- Core `JavaHttpClient` does not support streaming due to limitations with `HttpURLConnection`

### v3.21.1

- Fix #109 - Jackson treats integer values inconsistently, leading to matching errors when using hamkrest.

### v3.21.0

- Fix #107 - Killed the x-uri-template header and fixed the ReportHttpTransaction to have access to the `routingGroup`.
- Altered ordering of filters in `http4k-contract` so that the route is identified before pre-filters and security are
  applied. This allows knowledge of the path to be accessible at the time of application of those filters.

### v3.20.0

- Introduce JavaHttpClient to `http4k-core`. It provides a very basic http client without any other 3rd party
  dependencies.

### v3.19.0

- PR #104 - Add optional time/date formatters to LensSpecs so you can choose you serialisation format. H/T @elifarley
- Fix #105 - Swagger API json file: duplicate key in "definitions".

### v3.18.1

- Fixed PR #100 - URI template regex required extra escaping. This only affects Android deployments as IDE shows the
  regex escaping is redundant. H/T @privatwolke

### v3.18.0

- Breaking: converted contract pre-security filter to be a post-security filter. This means that all standard filters
  are applied before the security later, which allows for logging and monitoring and context setup. The previous filter
  mechanic applied security first, which didn't allow for this. In the unlikely event that post-security filters still
  need to be applied, use the `withPostSecurityFilter()` function when building the contract.
- Docs for contract RouteMeta function parameters, and deprecated some unused functions (missed when we introduced the
  DSL).
- PR #99 - Contract routes now support up to 10 path segments. Thanks to @scap1784 for the PR! :)

### v3.17.1

- Fix #97. Moshi does not fail when deserialise non-nullable fields correctly. Note that GSON still suffers from this
  problem

### v3.17.0

- Added a pre-security filter option to contract creation, so that you can explicitly specify behaviour to occur before
  security kicks in.

### v3.16.0

- Convert `Security` (from sealed class) and `ApiKey` to be interfaces. This allows users to implement their own
  security models.

### v3.15.0

- Introduce `HttpTransaction` and new `ReportHttpTransaction` filter provide better generic API for reporting, along
  with the ability to label transactions for this purpose.
- Breaking: Rework the metrics request counter and timer Filter API. There is now a `HttpTransactionLabeller` for you to
  add as many labels as required to the transaction. Each of these labels will be used to tag the metric.

### v3.14.1

- Fix #95 - Filters are now applied to "route not found" responses

### v3.14.0

- Fix #93 - Apache server doesn't like content-length or transfer-encoding headers present in http4k response.
- Add ability to "name" input and output contract body definitions in an OpenAPI JSON doc. This applies to only the top
  level entity. If no override is passed, the objects are named according to their hashcode.

### 3.13.4

- Fix #92 - cookie date should always use US locale

### v3.13.3

- Further tweak to Netty. H/T @FredDeschenes

### v3.13.2

- Fix #91 - large message handli
  ng in Netty

### v3.13.1

- Upgrade to Kotlin 1.2.20

### v3.13.0

- Support for `operationId` in OpenApi route metadata. H/T @danschultz for the PR.
- Removed previously deprecated methods.

### v3.12.0

- New client module `http4k-client-jetty`, which supports both sync and async models.

### v3.11.1

- Fix #84. OPTIONS requests are not detected by contract routes.
- Added option to NOT authorise OPTIONS requests in ApiKey security filter.
- Added support for Async HTTP clients and added new `AsyncHttpClient` interface, which is obviously used for HTTP
  clients only**, and not server-side calls. :)
- New client module `http4k-client-apache-async`.
- New metrics gathering module `http4k-metrics-micrometer`. Big H/T to @kirderf for the PR.
- Added support for async to `OkHttp` client module.

### v3.10.0

- P/R 81 - adding headers and timeout to websocket client.

### v3.9.0

- Added compactify and prettify to Json implementations
- Added `Json.hasBody` Hamkrest matchers for comparing bodies. Note these are extension methods and need to be
  referenced/imported as such.

### v3.8.0

- Added facility for non-blocking websocket client to react to onConnect event. This API is
  the same as the inbound, server-side API - ie. there are no explicit connection event handlers. H/T @tom for the idea.

### v3.7.0

- P/R #13 Create extension methods for Response to add caching headers. H/T @k0zakinio.

### v3.6.1

- Fix #78. Serialisation of raw lists using Moshi fails in the same way as the Jackson auto-conversions do. Added
  convenience methods to get around this.

### v3.6.0

- Added `http4k-format-moshi` to support the Square auto-marshalling library.

### v3.5.1

- Fix #76 - encoding of path segments to use URI encoding instead of URL form encoding.

### v3.5.0

- Added support for multiple HotReload template directories in `HandlebarsTemplates`. H/T @TomShacham
- Fix #74 - Request tracing span/parentSpan set too early so was shared between outgoing requests.

### v3.4.0

- New server backend `http4k-server-apache`. H/T @kirderf for the PR :)
- We now set the length of the incoming request body when it is available in the incoming request.

### v3.3.1

- Handlebars now uses combination of Class and Template name to cache templates.

### v3.3.0

- Facility to compose `TemplateRenderers` with `then()` to provide fallback behaviour.

### v3.2.3

- PR #70: Header order equality for Request/Response - H/T @gypsydave5.

### v3.2.2

- Switched out `Status` for `WsStatus` (with proper RFC code set) in Websockets.

### v3.2.1

- Typesafe Websockets! Jetty now supports websockets, using the same style of API in the main http4k routing.
- (Possible) Breaking change: Because `WsHandler` (typealias) implements the same inbound interface as `HttpHandler`,
  you now cannot declare `HttpHandlers` without specifying the input type, so any "anonymous" handlers will not compile
  as a result. The required fix is very simple, but manual:
  `{ Response(OK) } should become { _:Request -> Response(OK) }

### v3.1.3

- Fix Request.form() for streaming requests

### v3.1.2

- Remove possibility of empty message for Path Lens failure.

### v3.1.1

- New (better!) API for `http4k-contract` module. Old meta DSL has been deprecated.

### v3.0.1

- Fix #63 - Apache Client Connect. timeout exception handling.

### v3.0.0

- Added `http4k-serverless-lambda` module, allowing http4k applications to be deployed into AWS Lambda and then called
  from API Gateway. Effectively, the combination of these two services become just another Server back-end supported by
  the library. \o/

### v2.38.1

- `RequestContextKey` now follow the standardised Lens structure of required, optional, defaulted, and can now be
  removed (set to null). Replace calls
  to `RequestContextKey.of()` with `RequestContextKey.required()`
- Removed previously deprecated values. See below for details on replacements.

### v2.37.0

- Added `http4k-resilience4j` module, which adds Circuits, RateLimiters, Retrying and Bulkheading.
- Fix #60 (H/T @michaelhixson for the spot).

### v2.36.0

- Added a couple of useful `ServerFilters`.
- Upgrade various dependency versions.
- Tidying of Multipart code.

### v2.35.1

- Fix #57. Static handlers behave oddly when combined with an HTTP verb in the routing tree.

### v2.35.0

- Fix #56. Altered behaviour of `CatchLensFailure` to NOT catch errors from unmarshalling Response objects. This was
  causing BAD_REQUEST to be incorrectly generated.
- Simplification of generics around LensSpecs. This should not be a breaking change, (there were 3 generics, now the MID
  has been removed so there are just 2) but could break if signatures are used explicitly.

### v2.34.0

- Reordered generics in LensInjector to make sense. This should have no effect on most code-bases, but could break if
  signatures are used explicitly. Just flip the generic types to switch.

### v2.33.1

- Added support for unsigned AWS requests, which enables streaming content to S3.

### v2.33.0

- Added `BodyMode.Request` to configure streaming for clients.
- `ResponseBodyMode` is now `BodyMode.Response` (Breaking change. Fixable with simple find/replace).

### v2.32.0

- Added `ServerFilter.ProcessFiles` filter to stream Multipart Files, convert them into references and replace inline in
  the Form.

### v2.31.4

- Avoid realising StreamBody unless necessary, which could break common usages of streaming.

### v2.31.3

- Tweaks to Server backends to improve efficiency.

### v2.31.2

- Webdriver will keep only the final URI after redirects.

### v2.31.1

- Increased granularity of `Replay.DiskStream` and ensure that traffic is returned in exact order on all OSes.
- Add support for redirects to Webdriver.

### v2.31.0

- Multipart module tweaked to provide a more consistent API.
- Fix FollowRedirects for POST/PUT request.

### v2.30.0

- Multipart form support through new module `http4k-multipart`.
- Deprecation: Replaced `Swagger` with `OpenApi` and deprecated the former (via typealias).
- Deprecation: Replaced `FormValidator` with `Validator` and deprecated the former (via typealias).
