http4k Connect is a lightweight API Client toolkit which includes libraries for connecting to popular third-party cloud 
services and AI backends using [http4k](https://http4k.org) compatible APIs, along with Fake implementations for usage during local
testing. These are all underpinned by a variation on the
uniform [Server as a Function](https://monkey.org/~marius/funsrv.pdf) model powered by the `HttpHandler` interface
exposed by [http4k Core](https://www.http4k.org/ecosystem/http4k/), so you can:
 
1. Take advantage of the simple and powerful SaaF model and APIs used in http4k.
1. Plug everything together completely in-memory and take advantage of this powerful model.
1. Have access to the underlying HTTP clients (and hence add metrics or logging).
1. Run stateful Fake implementations of 3rd party systems locally or in test environments.

Although centered around usage in http4k-based projects, http4k-connect does not require this and the libraries are usable from any JVM application.

## Rationale
Although convenient, many API Client libraries introduce many heavyweight dependencies or contain a plethora of non-required functionality, which can have a large effect on binary size. As an alternative, http4k-connect provides lightweight versions of popular APIs covering standard use-cases.

## Installation
```kotlin
dependencies {
    // install the platform...
    implementation(platform("org.http4k:http4k-bom:5.36.0.0"))

    // ...then choose an API Client
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-connect-amazon-s3")

    // ...and a storage backend (optional)
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-connect-storage-redis")

    // ...a fake for testing (optional)
    testImplementation("org.http4k:http4k-connect-amazon-s3-fake")
}
```
