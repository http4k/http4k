### How to write a custom server implmentation

Whilst the http4k server modules ship with a sensibly configured standard server-backend setup, a lot of projects will require specialised implementations of the underlying server backend. http4k makes this easy with the `ServerConfig` interface.

### Gradle setup

```groovy
implementation group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-core", version: "3.274.0"
implementation group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-server-jetty", version: "3.274.0"
```

The example below shows a customised Jetty setup which enables HTTPS traffic by reimplementing the `ServerConfig` interface. The idea is that this single class will encapsulate the usage of the Server platform API behind the http4k abstraction and provide a simple way to reuse it across different applications.
