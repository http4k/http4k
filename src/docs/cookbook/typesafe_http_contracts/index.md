title: http4k Typesafe, Documented Applications
description: Recipes for using the http4k-contract module to provide typesafe endpoints with automatically generated OpenAPI documentation

This contract example shows:

- 2 endpoints with typesafe contracts (marshalling of path parameters and bodies)
- Custom filters (reporting latency)
- API key security via a typesafe Query parameter (this can be a header or a body parameter as well)
- OpenApi v3 documentation - Run this example and point a browser [here](https://http4k.org/openapi3?url=http://localhost:8000/context/swagger.json)

### Gradle setup
```
    compile group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-core", version: "3.242.0"
    compile group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-contract", version: "3.242.0"
    compile group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-format-argo", version: "3.242.0"
```

Note: although we use Argo here as our JSON API, you could also switch in any of the `http4k-format-xxx` JSON modules.
