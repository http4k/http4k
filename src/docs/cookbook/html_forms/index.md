title: http4k HTML Forms
description: Recipes for using http4k with HTML forms

HTML form support is provided on 2 levels:

1. Through the use of `form()` extension methods on `Request` to get/set String values.
1. Using the Lens system, which adds the facility to define form fields in a typesafe way, and to validate form contents (in either a strict (400) or "feedback" mode).

### Gradle setup

```groovy
implementation group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-core", version: "3.261.0"
```

### Standard (non-typesafe) API [<img class="octocat"/>](https://github.com/http4k/http4k/blob/master/src/docs/cookbook/html_forms/example_standard.kt)
