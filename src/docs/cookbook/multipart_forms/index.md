title: http4k Multipart Forms
description: Recipes for using http4k with Multipart forms

Multipart form support is provided on 2 levels:

1. Through the creation of a `MultipartFormBody` which can be set on a `Request`.
1. Using the Lens system, which adds the facility to define form fields in a typesafe way, and to validate form contents (in either a strict (400) or "feedback" mode).

### Gradle setup
```
    compile group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-core", version: "3.209.0"
    compile group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-multipart", version: "3.209.0"
```
