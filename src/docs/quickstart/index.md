# Quickstart 

This simple example demonstrates how to serve and consume HTTP services using **http4k**. To install, add these dependencies to your **Gradle** file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation platform("org.http4k:http4k-bom:3.268.0")
    implementation "org.http4k:http4k-core"
    implementation "org.http4k:http4k-server-netty"
    implementation "org.http4k:http4k-client-apache"
}
```

The following creates a simple endpoint, binds it to a Netty server then starts, queries, and stops it.
