<h3>Hello!</h3>

<p>
  We've had a bit of a redesign of the http4k documentation system. If you're here then it's possible that you've been
  sent here by a search engine before it's had the opportunity to reindex all of our content. To help you out (and
  because we haven't set up elaborate redirection rules), take a look at the URL you were trying to access and use the
  following guidance to select the correct entry from the navigation on the right:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/guide/concepts/rationale">/rationale</a> content has moved to the <a href="/guide/concepts/rationale">Rationale</a></li>
  <li><a href="/guide/howto">/cookbook/*</a> content has moved to the <a href="/guide/howto">How-To section</a></li>
  <li><a href="/guide/reference">/module/*</a> content has moved to the <a href="/guide/reference">Module reference</a></li>
</ul>
