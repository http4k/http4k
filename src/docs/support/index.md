- **Slack room:** #http4k @ <a href="http://slack.kotlinlang.org/">slack.kotlinlang.org</a>

**Note:** As a general rule, you'll get a quicker response from the Slack channel.

## http4k Training
Whilst we hope that http4k is a simple library to use, there are significant nuances to being able to use it most effectively, especially around the areas of advanced application testing, deployment strategies, and migration to Kotlin-based development for Java-heritage teams.

The http4k creators have used http4k on projects both (very) big and small, so can advise in this area with a lot of experience gained from experience. For this purpose, the team have developed various training materials which can be delivered to project teams.

If you feel that you would like to take advantage of these experiences to turbo-charge your application development programs, please get in touch, so we can talk about how best the team could help.

## Commercial Support
We recognise that although organisations use happily Open Source Software such as **http4k**, they may gain additional peace of mind from having direct access to expert advice. For this purpose, the project creators offer a range of professional services to support library users in making the most of the powerful feature set which **http4k** provides, including:

- System architecture and design review
- Testing strategy and implementation review
- Project-level Developer and Team mentoring
- On-site **http4k** talks and training
- Troubleshooting integration issues and debugging
- Kotlin language Developer training
- Advice on extending or creating custom builds of **http4k**
