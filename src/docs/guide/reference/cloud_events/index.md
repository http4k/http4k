title: http4k Cloud Events support
description: Feature overview of the http4k-cloudevents module

### Installation (Gradle)

```groovy
implementation group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-cloudevents", version: "4.25.7.0"
```

The [Cloud Events](https://cloudevents.io/) spec defines a common format for Events produced by Cloud services.

http4k provides simple pluggability into the CloudEvents Java SDKs and custom event format libraries via the Lens system - making it trivial to both receive or send CloudEvents in the standard way.

### Example 

In this example we are using the Jackson JSONFormat which is included by default with the `http4k-cloudevents` module. If you want to also use the lenses to access typed EventData, you will also need this in your Gradle file:

```groovy
// to access the lenses in the Jackson module
implementation group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-format-jackson", version: "4.25.7.0"

```
