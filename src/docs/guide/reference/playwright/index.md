### About

A JUnit extension for simply testing your http4k applications using the Playwright browser-automation library.

Create your application as normal and pass to the JUnit extension when registering it. The application is then launched
on a random port and a connected browser object injected into the test - requests to non-http URLs are automatically
routed to your app.
