title: http4k GraphQL module
description: Feature overview of the http4k-graphql module.

### Installation (Gradle)

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("org.http4k:http4k-bom:5.12.2.1"))
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-graphql")

### About
This module provides http4k integration for the excellent [GraphQL-java](https://www.graphql-java.com/) library, allowing you to either serve or consume [GraphQL] services using a simple adapter API.

As with the [ethos](/guide/concepts/rationale) of http4k, the uniform Server/Client GraphQLHandler model means that you can test applications entirely in-memory without binding to a port. Http4k also ships with a page serving the GraphQL playground which can be added as a simple route.
