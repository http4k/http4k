### About
This module provides http4k integration for the excellent [GraphQL-java](https://www.graphql-java.com/) library, allowing you to either serve or consume [GraphQL] services using a simple adapter API.

As with the ethos of http4k, the uniform Server/Client GraphQLHandler model means that you can test applications entirely in-memory without binding to a port.
