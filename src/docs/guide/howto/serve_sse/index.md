title: http4k How-to: Serve SSE
description: Recipes for using http4k with Server-Sent Events

### Gradle setup

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("org.http4k:http4k-bom:5.23.0.0"))
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-core")
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-server-undertow")
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-server-jetty")
}
```

**http4k** provides SSE (Server Sent Events) support using a simple, consistent, typesafe, and testable API on supported server backends (see above). SSE communication consists of 3 main concepts:

1. `SseHandler` - represented as a typealias: `SseHandler =  (Request) -> SseConsumer`. This is responsible for matching an HTTP request to an SSE handler.
1. `SseConsumer` - represented as a typealias: `SseConsumer = (Sse) -> Unit`. This function is called on connection of a Sse and allow the API user to receive to events coming from the connected SSE handler.
1. `SseMessage` - a message which is sent from the SSE handler SseMessages are immutable data classes.
1. `SseFilter` - represented as a interface: `SseFilter = (SseConsumer) -> SseConsumer`. This allows for the decoration of `SseConsumers` to add pre or post matching behaviour in the same way as a standard `Filter`.

### SSE as a Function
The simplest possible SSE handler can be mounted as a `SseConsumer` function onto a server with:
```kotlin
{ sse: Sse -> sse.send(SseMessage.Data("hello")) }.asServer(Undertow(9000)).start()
```

### Mixing HTTP and SSE services [<img class="octocat"/>](https://github.com/http4k/http4k/blob/master/src/docs/guide/howto/serve_sse/example_polyhandler.kt)
Both SSE and Http handlers in **http4k** are routed using a similar path-based API. We combine them into a single `PolyHandler`. SSE handlers react to HTTP traffic which send an `Accept` header with `text/event-stream` value:
