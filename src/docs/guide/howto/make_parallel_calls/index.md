title: http4k How-to: Make HTTP calls in parallel
description: Recipe to make HTTP calls in parallel using a ThreadPoolExecutor

There are cases where an application needs to make multiple HTTP calls to other services as part of handling a particular request. 
As a general rule-of-thumb, we recommend people to avoid [premature optimisation], however sometimes the quantity of calls or performance of other services demand those to be executed in parallel.

In this example, we show how to use the extension function on [ExecutionService] to manage multiple HTTP calls in parallel, and synchronise their results to produce a single response.

This recipe also covers how to make [distributed tracing] work when tracing information is consumed by multiple threads.
