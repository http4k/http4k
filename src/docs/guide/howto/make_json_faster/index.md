title: http4k How-to: Make JSON Faster
description: Recipes to make JSON faster through the use of lighter reflection or code generation

The standard JSON format modules included in Http4k (like Jackson and Moshi) are good enough for most applications.
However there are scenarios where you may want to further optimize them for runtime performance,
or to achieve acceptable cold start times in serverless deployments.

## kotlinx.serialization

[kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) is a relatively simple and effective option.
It's fully supported by Http4k, but we'll go over it first as a baseline to compare against the others.
It generates the serialization adapters at compile time, which means it doesn't need reflection during runtime.

kotlinx.serialization is a very fast and efficient module, but there are some caveats to consider:

1. No support for many builtin JVM types (e.g. java.time, UUID)
2. Custom serializers must be registered via annotation
3. No support for values4k classes

### Gradle

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("plugin.serialization") version "1.9.22"
}

dependencies {
    implementation(platform("org.http4k:http4k-bom:5.17.0.0"))
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-format-kotlinx-serialization")
}
```

## Moshi Metadata Reflect

[moshi-metadata-reflect](https://github.com/ZacSweers/MoshiX/tree/main/moshi-metadata-reflect) is a plugin for Moshi that replaces the heavyweight `kotlin-reflect` with the lighter `kotlinx-metadata-jvm`.
While this module still uses reflection, eliminating `kotlin-reflect` from your classpath will reduce your binary size by several MB and make a respectable improvement in cold start time.

Moshi Metadata Reflect is very simple, and doesn't require any gradle plugins or finicky code generation.
However, it will bring the smallest performance benefit out of these options.

### Gradle

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("org.http4k:http4k-bom:5.17.0.0"))
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-format-moshi") {
        exclude("org.jetbrains.kotlin", "kotlin-reflect") // Exclude kotlin-reflect
    }
    implementation("dev.zacsweers.moshix:moshi-metadata-reflect:0.23.0")
}
```

## Kotshi

[Kotshi](https://github.com/ansman/kotshi) is a plugin for Moshi.  It's very similar to [moshi-kotlin-codegen](https://github.com/square/moshi/tree/master/moshi-kotlin-codegen)
in that they both generate Moshi adapters at compile time.
However, since `moshi-kotlin-codegen` still requires `kotlin-reflect` at runtime, `kotshi` can bring much greater cold start performance gains.

Kotshi is a very fast and efficient module, but is the most difficult to set up.
It requires a gradle plugin, several dependencies, and depends on code that only exists after compile.

### Gradle

```kotlin
plugins {
    // The KSP plugin is required to generate the adapters at compile time
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "1.9.22-1.0.16"
}

dependencies {
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-format-moshi") {
        exclude("org.jetbrains.kotlin", "kotlin-reflect") // Exclude kotlin-reflect
    }
    
    // Get the Kotshi runtime library and configure KSP to generate the adapters
    implementation("se.ansman.kotshi:api:2.15.0")
    ksp("se.ansman.kotshi:compiler:2.15.0")
}
```
