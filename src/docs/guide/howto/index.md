### How-to guides

The meat of the http4k documentation is in this section, in which you'll find ready made solutions to many common use-cases. Because if you've got something to achieve - it's pretty likely that we've probably come across it already 😉. Check out the nav on the left for the list of recipes.

The format for the recipes contains:
- Required Gradle dependencies
- A brief description of the problem
- Fully runnable code example displaying the solution.

Think of it like a mini StackOverflow - but better because you've got the entire solution available to adapt to your particular use-case - 😃.

As a community-driven project, we would welcome new or updated recipes to make http4k easier to use. The format of the new and updated recipes should follow [this Markdown template](https://github.com/http4k/http4k/blob/master/.github/RECIPE_TEMPLATE.md).
