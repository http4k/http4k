title: http4k How-to: Create a custom JSON marshaller
description: Recipes for using JSON in http4k applications with a variety of popular JSON APIS

### Gradle setup

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("org.http4k:http4k-bom:5.10.2.0"))
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-core")
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-format-jackson")
}
```

### Custom auto-mapping JSON configurations

**http4k** declares an extended set of "primitive" types which it can marshall out of the box - this includes the
various http4k primitives (Uri, Status), as well as a bunch of common types from the JDK such as the DateTime classes
and Exceptions. These primitives types cannot be marshalled as top-level JSON structures on their own so should be
contained in a custom wrapper class before transmission.

You can declare your own custom marshaller by reimplementing the Json instance and adding mappings for your own types -
either uni or bi-directional.

This ability to render custom types through different JSON marshallers allows API users to provide different "views" for
different purposes - for example we may wish to hide the values of some fields in the output, as below:

### Example - Representing MicroTypes/TinyTypes as Strings in JSON

MicroTypes (aka Tiny Types) are popular in Kotlin providing type-safety throughout a codebase, ensuring amongst other things that method 
parameters are not accidentally permuted. An example of a simple microtype might be:

```kotlin
data class CustomerName(val value: String)
data class Customer(val name: CustomerName)
```

Using the standard mapper, a `Customer` "Bob", would be represented as the json

```kotlin
Customer(name = CustomerName("Bob"))
```

```json
{
    "name": {
        "value": "Bob"
    }
}
```

However, it might be preferable to represent `CustomerName` as a plain string:

```json
{
    "name": "Bob"
}
```

To achieve this, there are a few simple steps - this example uses Jackson, but there are equivalent configuration
schemes for the other supported JSON libraries

1. Use the http4k `ConfigurableJackson` to get a base configuration

```kotlin
object MyJackson : ConfigurableJackson(
    // to be filled in
) 
```

2. Modify it to meet your needs, registering type adapters for your types

```kotlin
object MyJackson : ConfigurableJackson(
    KotlinModule.Builder.Build()              // register kotlin types
        .asConfigurable()
        .withStandardMappings()               // http4k out-of-the box extras
        .text(::CustomerName, CustomerName::value)    // here is the registration of custom type
        // .text(...) - repeat the registration for each type
        .done()
        .deactivateDefaultTyping()  // other Jackson config...
        .configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, false)
)
```

3. Reference this configuration in your code - particularly where using the `Body.auto<xxx>` pattern

```kotlin
import guide.howto.create_a_custom_json_marshaller.MyJackson.auto

val lens = Body.auto<Customer>().toLens()  // ... continue as before
```

### Example - Representing MicroTypes using Values4k as Strings in JSON

This example uses value types from [Values4k](https://github.com/fork-handles/forkhandles/tree/trunk/values4k)

Firstly, define a value type using the standard values4k mechanism - note that the companion
object extends ValueFactory - this will be referenced in the type adapter later. The ValueFactory
also provides a number of convenience methods `CustomerName.of()`, `parse()`, `unwrap()`, and a mechanism
to validate the format of strings - very convenient to ensure that values are semantically valid throughout the entire system.

```kotlin
class CustomerName(value: String) : StringValue(value) {
    companion object : StringValueFactory<CustomerName>(::CustomerName)
}
```

Then, define a `ConfigurableJackson` (Moshi...) with a type adaptor for your type

```kotlin
object MyJackson : ConfigurableJackson(
    KotlinModule.Builder.Build()
        .asConfigurable()
        .withStandardMappings()
        .value(CustomerName) // this references the CustomerName companion object
        // .value(...) - repeat the registration for each type
        .done()
        .deactivateDefaultTyping()  // other Jackson config...
        .configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, false)
)
```
