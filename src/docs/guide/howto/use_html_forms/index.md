title: http4k How-to: Use HTML Forms
description: Recipes for using http4k with HTML forms

HTML form support is provided on 2 levels:

1. Through the use of `form()` extension methods on `Request` to get/set String values.
1. Using the Lens system, which adds the facility to define form fields in a typesafe way, and to validate form contents (in either a strict (400) or "feedback" mode).

### Gradle setup

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("org.http4k:http4k-bom:5.10.2.0"))
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-core")
}
```
