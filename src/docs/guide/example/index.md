## Application Design
What follows is a guide to *how* we build **http4k** applications test first to provide excellent test coverage driven by decoupled tests. 

For this example, we will use an example of a Maths app with the following requirements:
* The app must add 2 numbers together via an HTTP call
* The app must multiply 2 numbers together via an HTTP call
* Answers generated by the service will be logged (via HTTP POST) to another server - the Recorder.

Apps can generally be split into 3 tiers:

1. Endpoint: `HttpHandlers` are constructed individually, by providing a builder function which takes the business-level dependencies. 
2. Application: Builder function which takes the transport-level dependencies, and converts them into business-level dependencies. All routes are constructed and collected in this tier.
3. Server: Builder function which takes the configuration for environmental concerns such as ports and downstream urls.
