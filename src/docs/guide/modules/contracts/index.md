### About
The `http4k-contract` module adds a much more sophisticated routing mechanism to that available in `http4k-core`. It adds the facility 
to declare server-side `Routes` in a completely typesafe way, leveraging the Lens functionality from the core. These `Routes` are 
combined into `RouteModules`, which have the following features:

- **Auto-validating** - the `Route` contract is automatically validated on each call for required-fields and type conversions, removing the requirement  for any validation code to be written by the API user. Invalid calls result in a `HTTP 400
 (BAD_REQUEST)` response.     
- **Self-describing:** - a generated endpoint is provided which describes all of the `Routes` in that module. Implementations include [OpenApi/Swagger](http://swagger.io/) documentation, including generation of [JSON schema]
(http://json-schema.org/) models for messages.
- **Security:** to secure the `Routes`  against unauthorised access. Current implementations include `ApiKey`.

When launched, OpenApi/Swagger format documentation (including JSON schema models) can be found at the route of the module.
