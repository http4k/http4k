title: http4k AWS Module
description: Feature overview of the http4k-aws module

### Installation (Gradle)

```groovy
implementation group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-aws", version: "3.273.0"
```

### About
This module provides 2 things:
1. a http4k compatible `SdkHttpClient`. This is so you can puse the standard Amazon SDKs libraries by plugging in a standard `HttpHandler`. This simplifies fault testingm and means that you can print out the exact traffic which is going to AWS - which is brilliant for both debugging and writing Fakes. :)

2. super-simple AWS request signing functionality for talking to AWS services. Once configured with the correct keys, the various AWS services are actually really simple to integrate with they're just RESTy-type HTTPS services - the main difficulty is that all requests need to have their contents digitally signed with the AWS credentials to be authorised.

http4k provides a `Filter` which does this request signing process. Just decorate a standard HTTP client and then make the relevant calls:
