### HTTP
Supported HTTP client adapter APIs are wrapped to provide an `HttpHandler` interface in 1 LOC.

Activate streaming mode by passing a `BodyMode` (default is non-streaming).

These examples are for the Apache HTTP client, but the API is similar for the others:

Additionally, all HTTP client adapter modules allow for custom configuration of the relevant underlying client. Async-supporting clients implement the `AsyncHttpClient` interface can be passed a callback.

### Websocket
http4k supplies both blocking and non-blocking Websocket clients. The former is perfect for integration testing purposes, and as it uses the same interface `WsClient` as the in-memory test client (`WsHandler.testWsClient()`) it is simple to write unit tests which can then be reused as system tests by virtue of swapping out the client.
