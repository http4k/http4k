title: http4k JSON-RPC Module
description: Feature overview of the http4k-jsonrpc module

### Installation (Gradle)
```compile group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-jsonrpc", version: "3.233.0"```

### About

Support for JSON-RPC handlers, with support for both manual and automatic marshalling modes.

Each service method "name" is bound to a particular endpoint function and then the entire API is 
exposed as a standard http4k `HttpHandler`, so it can be composed with other HttpHandlers and Filters.

A specialised ErrorHandler can also be assigned to the RPC contract.

Note that in order to activate JSON RPC, you need to import one of the supported JSON modules.
