title: http4k JSON Message Format Modules
description: Feature overview of the JSON http4k-format modules, several of which support auto-marshalling into data classes.

```

### About
These modules add the ability to use JSON as a first-class citizen when reading from and to HTTP messages. Each 
implementation adds a set of standard methods and extension methods for converting common types into native JSON/XML 
objects, including custom Lens methods for each library so that JSON node objects can be written and read directly from
 HTTP messages:

### Auto-marshalling capabilities

Some of the message libraries (eg. GSON, Jackson, Moshi, XML) provide the mechanism to automatically marshall data objects 
to/from JSON and XML using reflection.

We can use this facility in [http4k] to automatically marshall objects to/from HTTP message bodies using **Lenses**:

There is a utility to generate Kotlin data class code for JSON documents [here](http://http4k-data-class-gen.herokuapp.com). 
These data classes are compatible with using the `Body.auto<T>()` functionality. 

#### FAQ (aka gotchas) regarding Auto-marshalling capabilities

**Q. Where is the `Body.auto` method defined?**

**A.** `Body.auto` is an extension method which is declared on the parent singleton `object` for each of the message libraries that supports auto-marshalling - eg. `Jackson`, `Gson`, `Moshi` and `Xml`. All of these objects are declared in the same package, so you need to add an import similar to:
`import org.http4k.format.Jackson.auto`

**Q. Using Jackson, the Data class auto-marshalling is not working correctly when my JSON fields start with capital letters**

**A.** Because of the way in which the Jackson library works, uppercase field names are NOT supported. Either switch out to use `http4k-format-gson` (which has the same API), or annotate your Data class with `@JsonNaming(PropertyNamingStrategy.UpperCamelCaseStrategy.class)` or the fields with `@JsonAlias` or to get it work correctly.

**Q. Using Jackson, Boolean properties with names starting with "is" do not marshall properly**

**A.** This is due to the way in which the Jackson `ObjectMapper` is configured. Annotation of the fields in question should help, or using `ObjectMapper.disable(MapperFeature.AUTO_DETECT_IS_GETTERS)`

**Q. Using Gson, the data class auto-marshalling does not fail when a null is populated in a Kotlin non-nullable field**

**A.** This happens because [http4k] uses straight GSON demarshalling, of JVM objects with no-Kotlin library in the mix. The nullability generally gets checked at compile-type and the lack of a Kotlin sanity check library exposes this flaw. No current fix - apart from to use the Jackson demarshalling instead!

**Q. Declared with `Body.auto<List<XXX>>().toLens()`, my auto-marshalled List doesn't extract properly!**

**A.** This occurs in Moshi when serialising bare lists to/from JSON and is to do with the underlying library being lazy in deserialising objects (using LinkedHashTreeMap) ()). Use `Body.auto<Array<MyIntWrapper>>().toLens()` instead. Yes, it's annoying but we haven't found a way to turn if off.

This can be demonstrated by the following, where you can see that the output of the auto-unmarshalling a naked JSON is NOT 
the same as a native Kotlin list of objects. This can make tests break as the unmarshalled list is NOT equal to the native list.

As shown, a workaround to this is to use `Body.auto<Array<MyIntWrapper>>().toLens()` instead, and then compare using 
`Arrays.equal()`
