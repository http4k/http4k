```

### About
These modules add the ability to use JSON as a first-class citizen when reading from and to HTTP messages. Each 
implementation adds a set of standard methods and extension methods for converting common types into native JSON/XML 
objects, including custom Lens methods for each library so that JSON node objects can be written and read directly from
 HTTP messages:

### Auto-marshalling capabilities

Some of the message libraries (eg. GSON, Jackson, Moshi, XML) provide the mechanism to automatically marshall data objects 
to/from JSON and XML using reflection.

We can use this facility in [http4k] to automatically marshall objects to/from HTTP message bodies using **Lenses**:

There is a utility to generate Kotlin data class code for JSON documents [here](http://http4k-data-class-gen.herokuapp.com). 
These data classes are compatible with using the `Body.auto<T>()` functionality. 

#### FAQ (aka gotchas) regarding Auto-marshalling capabilities

##### Uppercase JSON key names
The Jackson version of the automarshalling does NOT work for objects with uppercase key names - this is a known issue 
with the Jackson library and we are unable to fix it. Either use the GSON alternative, or annotate your Data class fields 
with `JsonAlias` annotations to work around this.

##### JSON arrays
When handling raw JSON array messages, such as: `[123, 456, 567]`, there is a slight gotcha when auto-marshalling messages 
from JSON.

This is demonstrated by the following, where you can see that the output of the auto-unmarshalling a naked JSON is NOT 
the same as a native Kotlin list of objects. This can make tests break as the unmarshalled list is NOT equal to the native list.

As shown, a workaround to this is to use `Body.auto<Array<MyIntWrapper>>().toLens()` instead, and then compare using 
`Arrays.equal()`
