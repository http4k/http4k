### About
Server-backend modules provide a consistent API to mount HttpHandlers into the specified container in 1 LOC, by 
simply passing it to the relevant `ServerConfig` implementation (in this case `Jetty`):

### Customisation
Each of the server backends implement an interface `ServerConfig`, which is written with sensible defaults for the server in questions, 
but is also designed to be used as a starting point for tweaking to API user needs. To customize, simply use the relevant `ServerConfig` 
class as a starting point and reimplement as required.
