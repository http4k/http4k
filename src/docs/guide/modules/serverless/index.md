title: http4k Serverless Modules
description: Feature overview of the http4k-serverless modules, covering Serverless backends

### Installation (Gradle)
```compile group: "org.http4k", name: "http4k-serverless-lambda", version: "3.233.0"```

### About
These modules provide integration with Serverless deployment environments, such as AWS Lambda. 

#### AWS Lambda integration
Since [http4k] is server independent, it turns out to be fairly trivial to deploy full applications to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda), and then call them by setting up the [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway) to proxy requests to the function. Effectively, the combination of these two services become just another Server back-end supported by the library. This has the added bonus that you can test your applications in a local environment and then simply deploy them to AWS Lambda via S3 upload.

In order to achieve this, only a single interface `AppLoader` needs to be implemented.

This is far from a complete guide, but configuring AWS Lambda and the API Gateway involves several stages:

1. Users, Roles and Policies for the API Gateway and Lambda.
1. API Gateway to proxy all requests to your Lambda.
1. Building your http4k application into a standard UberJar.
1. Optionally using Proguard to minify the JAR.
1. Package up the (minified) JAR into a standard Zip distribution.
1. Create and configure the Lambda function, and at the same time:

    1. Upload the standard Zip file to S3.
    1. Set the function execution to call the main http4k entry point: `org.http4k.serverless.lambda.LambdaFunction::handle`
    1. Set an environment variable for the Lambda `HTTP4K_BOOTSTRAP_CLASS` to the class of your `AppLoader` class.

We hope to soon provide some tools to automate at least some of the above process, or at least document it somewhat. However, AWS is a complicated beast and many people have a preferred way to set it up: CloudFormation templates, Serverless framework, Terraform, etc. In the meantime, here is an example of how the `AppLoader` is created and a sneak peak at launching the app locally:
