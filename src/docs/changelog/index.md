description: List of released changes for the httpk library

<h2 class="github">Changelog</h2>

This list is not currently intended to be all-encompassing - it will document major and breaking API changes with their rationale when appropriate:

### v3.33.0 (uncut)
- Upgrade various dependency versions

### v3.33.0
- Make Route a Router so we can nest them together.

### v2.2.1
- Remove excess "charset" from headers in Undertow

### v2.2.0
- Rename  `by()` to `bind()` in routing for clarity. 

### v2.1.2

### v2.0.5
- Fix #23. Contract now supports multi-part URL params (for hardcoded parts)

### v2.0.4
- Fix #22. Uri template does not parse out correct path params when URL starts with a path part.

### v2.0.3
- toString() implementations to aid debugging

### v2.0.1
- Readded missing default parameter for `newRequest()` on RouteSpec

### v2.0.0
- Breaking: Inversion of routing API. `GET to "/someUri"` is now `"/someUri" to GET` for consistency across the entire API.

### v1.32.2
- Fix Filters being applied twice in `ContractRoutingHttpHandler`

### v1.32.1
- More work on `http4k-contract` contract API

### v1.31.0
- Rework `http4k-contract` routing to be mounted in the same way as other `RoutingHttpHandlers`

### v1.30.0
- Filters are now applied consistently to all Routers

### v1.29.0

### v1.25.0
- Can add custom mime types to Static Content
- GenerateDataClasses is capable of more complex object graphs

### v1.15.0
- Path lenses are now bidirectional, so can be used to populate requests as well as bodies an headers etc.
- Routes can now create shell Requests for themselves, using `route.newRequest()`

### v1.14.0
- Body is now non-nullable (use `Body.EMPTY` instead)
- Rename methods `BodyLens` API for consistency and clarity. `required()` is now `toLens()`. `to()' binding method is now `of().

### v1.6.0

- Merge `org.http4k.core.Body` and `org.http4k.lens.Body`.

### v1.4.0
- Turn Body into ByteBuffer wrapper rather than typealias. That should make .toString() behave as most people would expected.
